# Data Leakage Analysis Report
## Corner Kick Shot Outcome Prediction
---

## Section A: Critical Leakage (MCC > 0.7)

**MUST REMOVE IMMEDIATELY**

| Feature | MCC | MI Score | RF Importance | Reasoning |
|---------|-----|----------|---------------|------------|
| is_shot_assist | 0.753 | 0.288 | 0.4915 | By definition only true if NEXT event is shot - direct target leakage |
| has_recipient | 0.303 | 0.049 | 0.0487 | Only labeled after ball successfully reaches someone |
| duration | 0.157 | 0.017 | 0.0305 | Event duration - how long until next event occurs |

## Section B: Strong Suspicion (MCC 0.3-0.7)

**Requires manual inspection**

| Feature | MCC | MI Score | RF Importance | Recommendation |
|---------|-----|----------|---------------|----------------|
| No suspicious features detected | | | | |

## Section C: Safe Features (MCC < 0.3)

## Section D: Revised Feature Set

### Clean Feature Set (Remove all critical leakage)

**Total clean features: 40** (from 61 original)

**Features removed: 8**

### Expected Impact

- **Performance drop**: Expect significant drop in accuracy/AUC after removing leaked features
- **If performance remains high**: Remaining features may still have leakage
- **Target baseline**: MCC ~0.1-0.2 is realistic for non-leaked features

### Suggested Alternative Features to Engineer

Since leaked features must be removed, consider these legitimate alternatives:

1. **Historical team performance** - Past corner success rate
2. **Player skill ratings** - Corner taker historical accuracy
3. **Tactical patterns** - Common formations from freeze-frame
4. **Pressure metrics** - Defensive pressure intensity
5. **Spatial entropy** - Player distribution randomness

## Summary Statistics

- Total features analyzed: 43
- Critical leakage: 3
- Strong suspicion: 0
- Safe features: 40
